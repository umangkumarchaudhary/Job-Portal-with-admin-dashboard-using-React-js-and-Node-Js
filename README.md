The Job Portal with Admin Dashboard is a web application designed to connect job seekers with potential employers. It features a job listings page for users to find job opportunities and an admin dashboard for authorized users to post new job listings. The application is developed using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Key Features

- Post new job listings through the admin dashboard.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface.
- Expandable and customizable for future enhancements.
